Gravity Tooltips
================

Add custom tooltips in Gravity Forms.

**Note:** Version 2.0.0 has numerous changes from previous versions, including a switch to using the [hint.css library by Kushagra Gour](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/ "hint.css library by Kushagra Gour") and removing all JS requirements. It may not be compatible with current implementations, please backup and test before updating any production sites.
